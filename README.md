  3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
  4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).

### infection rules:
  1. Any dead cell with a single live neighbor lives on to the next generation.
  2. Any live cell with no horizontal or vertical live neighbors dies.

## Instructions:
1. clone reposetory

run:

python game_of_life.py --width=<board width> --height=<board height> --infect_after=<infect after> --max_generations=<max generations> --seed=<seed>

for example:

python game_of_life.py --width=3 --height=3 --infect_after=3 --max_generations=6 --seed="0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0"
